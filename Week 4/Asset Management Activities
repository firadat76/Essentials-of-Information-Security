Activity 1 (Discovery)
Activity 2 (Risk)
Activity 3 (Policy)
Activity 4 (Monitoring)
Activity 5 (Business)
Activity 6 (Response)

Activity 1 → 2
Connection: The asset inventory spreadsheet from Lab 1 becomes the input for vulnerability scanning in Activity 2

Example: "Take the 4 web servers you discovered in Lab 1 and now scan them for vulnerabilities"

Activity 2 → 3
Connection: The vulnerability findings from Lab 2 inform the security control requirements in the Activity 3 policy

Example: "Because you found unpatched systems in Lab 2, your policy must include patch management requirements"

Activity 3 → 4
Connection: The policy from Lab 3 defines what should be monitored in Activity 4

Example: "Your policy requires detecting unauthorized assets, so build monitoring for that"

Activities 1-4 → 5
Connection: All previous data feeds the business impact analysis

Example: "Use your asset inventory + vulnerability data + monitoring findings to calculate actual business risk"

Activities 1-5 → 6
Connection: The complete asset management program enables effective incident response

Example: "During the incident, use your asset database to quickly identify affected systems"
